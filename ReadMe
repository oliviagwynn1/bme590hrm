This code works by using the 'create_dictionary.py' module, and inputting the
name of the file that you want to run in the 'if __name__ = "__main__"'
statements, where is is equal to 'data_file'.

This code then runs by importing all the functions from the various modules
into the file, and runs the data through each function one at a time. First
it runs through the 'reader.py' module, which reads the csv file, and creates
two numpy arrays. Then it runs through the 'validate.py' module, which ensures
that the two arrays (time and voltage) are the same length, as well as
ensuring that the time array has no negative values, and the voltage arrray
does not exceed any voltages of 300mv. After this it runs through the 'beats.py',
'num_beats.py', 'duration.py', 'mean_hr_bpm.py' and 'voltage_extremes.py' modules
to determine their corresponding values. Once these values are determined, the
data is run into the 'add_words' function to add the works and key pairs into
the empty dictionary called metrics, that was created using the 'metrics.py'
module. Finally, the code is run through the 'convert_json.py' module to
convert the dictionary into a json file and save it.
